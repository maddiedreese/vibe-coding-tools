# Vibe Coding Tools

I like making things — small web apps, concepts, prototypes, whatever idea’s in my head that week.

Here’s what I’m using right now, depending on what I’m building and how technical I feel that day.

## Web Apps

### [Lovable](https://lovable.dev)
If I had to pick one tool that perfectly fits my brain, it’s Lovable. It’s made for people who want to build fast, visually, and still end up with something real. I like that it doesn’t assume I want to go deep into code every time, but still gives me access to structure when I need it. I use it for most of my projects.

### [Cursor](https://cursor.com)
Cursor feels like having an AI co-developer who understands your context without getting in the way. It's what I go to when I'm working on a build that doesn't need to focus on the front end as much.

## Mobile Apps

### [Anything](https://www.createanything.com/?via=maddie)
If I want to build a mobile app straight from the browser, this is where I go. It’s easy to move fast without feeling boxed in, and it gives me a quick sense of how something might look or feel on a phone.

### [Natively](https://natively.dev)
Clean, modern, and doesn’t make you jump through hoops to test or publish.

### [Rork](https://rork.com) and [VibeCode](https://vibecodeapp.com)
Both of these let you build mobile apps inside mobile apps — which is pretty cool. They’re perfect for small, experimental builds or for testing app concepts without touching a computer.

## In-Between Zone

### [Bolt](https://bolt.new)
Bolt is ideal for “semi-technical” builds. It’s what I use when I know I’ll probably need to open a terminal at some point — maybe to install a package or deploy manually — but I still want the speed and structure of a visual editor. It’s also great for websites that need a bit of backend logic without becoming full-stack chaos.

## Core Stack

### [GitHub](https://github.com)
Still essential. Even for vibe coding, version control matters, and GitHub’s where I organize, share, and occasionally break things on purpose.

### [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
I use this less for “AI answers” and more like a thinking space. It helps me outline features, untangle logic, or write docs when I don’t want to overthink syntax. It’s basically a conversation partner for the planning phase.

### [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
I host almost everything here. It’s fast, free to start, and has the least friction of any hosting setup I’ve used. Perfect for small projects, portfolio sites, or just testing something live.

### [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
My favorite backend tool. It gives me a database, authentication, and storage, all with a dashboard that makes sense. It’s the kind of backend you can actually enjoy setting up, which is rare.

## ☕️ Final Thought

These tools let me start with an idea, and build it fast. Sometimes the goal is a working app. Sometimes it’s just getting the idea out of my head.
